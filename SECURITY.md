# :warning: Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Fonse owned repository, please report it to us as described below. Unfortunately, we do not offer bug bounties for any of our products.

## Supported versions
Either the latest (prefereble) or a penultimate version. It would be hard for us to revert to an older version and patch vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

To report vulnerabilities, go to the "[Security](https://github.com/shannonfonseka/VauhltDesktop/security)" tab and click on the "[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/shannonfonseka/VauhltDesktop/security/advisories/new)" button.

If you prefer to submit an email, please send an email to [hello.shannonfonseka@proton.me](mailto:hello.shannonfonseka@proton.me). If it is possible, encrypt your messages using our public PGP key. Download/view the [public PGP key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shannonfonseka/shannonfonseka/main/pgp/keyblock1.txt).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* The repository name or URL
* Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of the source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any particular configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Language
We prefer all communications to be in English language.

## Disclosure Guidelines
We ask you to follow our disclosure guidelines described below.

We ask the researchers to give us sufficient time to develop suitable patches for our products. In coordinated vulnerability disclosure, Fonse will coordinate with the researchers throughout the vulnerability investigation and provide updates on case progress.

Upon successful release of product security patches under coordinated vulnerability disclosure, Fonse will recognize the researchers for endorsing coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

Fonse recommends the research community to not disseminate any kind of information or tools that would help to exploit the vulnerability.
